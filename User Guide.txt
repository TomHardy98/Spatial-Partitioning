To run the 2D spatial hashing program:

Load the visual studio file, press f5 to compile and run in release mode.

When the GLFW window loads, move it over if it's covering the command console
(That's where the FPS and particle counts output)

When the program loads there will be 200 particles on screen.

You can change this from 10 to 10000 particles using the up and down arrows

up arrow - increases particles

down arrow - decreases particles

Enjoy! :)
